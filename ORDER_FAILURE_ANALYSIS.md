### **Response Format**

The system provides structured, human-readable responses with:

```
üîç Failure Analysis Report

Analysis Scope: System-wide failure analysis
Time Range: quarter
Orders Analyzed: 156

‚ùå Common Failure Reasons:
1. BUDGET CONSTRAINTS (45.2%)
   üí¨ "Security consulting costs ($40,000) exceed quarterly budget allocation..."

2. INSUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION (28.7%)
   üí¨ "Need more detailed business impact analysis..."

3. WRONG APPROVER (15.8%)
   üí¨ "This order requires VP-level approval..."

‚úÖ Success Factors:
‚Ä¢ Detailed Business Justification (High impact)
  Orders with >100 character justifications have 90% approval rate
‚Ä¢ Appropriate Budget Range (High impact)
  Orders within department budget limits rarely get rejected

‚ö° Immediate Actions:
‚Ä¢ Address common cybersecurity rejection reason: budget constraints
‚Ä¢ Consider reducing order amount or splitting into smaller orders
‚Ä¢ Strengthen business justification with specific ROI metrics

üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Strategies:
‚Ä¢ Check quarterly budget allocations before ordering high-value items
‚Ä¢ Include specific business metrics and compliance requirements
‚Ä¢ Verify approval hierarchy before submission

üéØ Confidence Score: 85%

üí° Key Insights:
‚Ä¢ Top failure reason: budget_constraints (45.2% of rejections)
‚Ä¢ Success rate can be improved by following 5 identified best practices
