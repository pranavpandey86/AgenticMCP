# SonarCloud analysis with coverage
dotnet-sonarscanner begin/end
```

## 🔒 Security Integration

### Package Vulnerability Scanning
- Scans all NuGet packages for known vulnerabilities
- Fails build if high-severity vulnerabilities found
- Reports include CVE details and remediation suggestions

### CodeQL Analysis
- Semantic analysis of C# code
- Detects security patterns and vulnerabilities
- Integration with GitHub Security tab

### Container Security
- Trivy scanning of Docker images
- Detection of OS package vulnerabilities
- Configuration security checks

### Dependency Analysis
- OWASP Dependency Check integration
- CVE database matching
- Configurable CVSS threshold

## 📊 Quality Gates

### SonarCloud Quality Gates
- **Coverage**: > 80% code coverage
- **Bugs**: 0 bugs allowed
- **Vulnerabilities**: 0 vulnerabilities allowed
- **Code Smells**: < 5% debt ratio
- **Duplicated Lines**: < 3%

### Build Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Docker image security scan must pass
- Performance tests within acceptable limits

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Preview Deployments (PRs)
- Automatic deployment to preview environment
- Preview URL generated and commented on PR
- Isolated environment for testing
- Automatic cleanup on PR close

### Production Deployments (Main Branch)
- Only after all quality gates pass
- Requires manual approval in production environment
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automatic rollback on failure

## 🐳 Docker Integration

### Multi-stage Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Build stage: SDK image for compilation
# Runtime stage: Minimal runtime image
# Security: Non-root user
# Health checks included
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
# Complete local development stack:
# - API service
# - MongoDB database
# - SonarQube (optional local analysis)
# - Nginx reverse proxy
```
